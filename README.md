# Task Manager CLI Application (Without Using Framework)


This CLI Task Manager is a simple command-line application designed to help users manage their to-do list. The application offers essential task management features such as adding, viewing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to a file, allowing users to reload their task list on their next login, making it easy to keep track of tasks over time.
